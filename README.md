# 🧠 Cain Galarza — Offensive Security Portfolio

Welcome to my lab journal and personal hacking portfolio. I'm a self-taught cybersecurity learner focused on web exploitation, red teaming, and digital tools that solve real-world problems — especially for reentry and social impact.

I don't just watch tutorials. I build, break, and rebuild to learn.

## 🔓 Web Exploitation & Pentesting Projects

### ✅ Full WordPress Exploit Chain (Self-Hosted Lab)
- Deployed a WordPress instance on Kali Linux using a custom LAMP stack.
- Exploited a vulnerable plugin to gain **remote shell access** as `www-data`.
- Extracted and cracked a **bcrypt password hash** using `John the Ripper` and `rockyou.txt`.
- Demonstrated post-exploitation techniques: accessing `wp-config.php`, enumerating users, and lateral movement.
- Built and deployed a custom **vulnerable plugin** for safe file upload testing.

### ⚙️ LAMP Stack Buildout (Manual Setup)
- Installed and configured Apache, PHP 8.4, and MariaDB on Kali Linux.
- Created and secured MySQL databases and users using CLI only.
- Tweaked PHP configs (`php.ini`) to allow plugin uploads and remove default limitations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Recon Experience

### 🕵️ Bug Bounty Recon Workflow
- Practiced real-world recon with:
  - `ReconFTW` (fully automated subdomain & port scanning)
  - `gau`, `ffuf`, `nmap`, `dirsearch`, and passive OSINT tools.
- Learned to chain passive and active recon for mapping live assets and open endpoints.

### 🧪 Termux Spyware Research (Android)
- Investigated the structure of Android keyloggers and spyware payloads for ethical research purposes.
- Learned how root access changes payload capability.
- Explored data exfiltration techniques over HTTP and socket shells within a safe, offline lab environment.

## 🧠 Hack The Box & CTF Foundations

- Completed beginner-level HTB labs with no solution walkthroughs.
- Practiced enumeration, exploitation, hash cracking, file upload bypasses, and privilege escalation.
- Focused on learning attack flow, not just flags.

## 🌍 Social Impact Tech (In Progress)

### 🚀 *OurNextStep* — Reentry App for Formerly Incarcerated Individuals
- Ideated features to help justice-impacted people get housing, employment, and document support.
- Planned tools like:
  - 📅 Probation check-in reminders
  - 📄 Document upload/scanning
  - 📲 Goal tracking and motivational prompts
- Driven by empathy, real-world interviews, and system change through tech.

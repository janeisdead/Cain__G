## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity learner building my skills one exploit at a time. I specialize in **real-world, hands-on labs** — not just theory. My work blends curiosity, discipline, and a mission to use technology to solve real problems, especially around reentry and justice system reform.

This repo documents what I’ve done, how I did it, and why it matters.

## 🧰 Projects & Skills

### 🔓 WordPress Exploitation Lab
- Built and exploited a full **WordPress LAMP environment** on Kali Linux.
- Uploaded a custom vulnerable plugin to achieve **remote code execution**.
- Gained a reverse shell, extracted `wp-config.php`, and dumped password hashes.
- Cracked a **bcrypt admin password** using `John the Ripper + rockyou.txt`.

### 🕵️ Bug Bounty Recon Practice
- Used tools like `ReconFTW`, `ffuf`, `gau`, and `nmap` to map assets and endpoints.
- Practiced passive recon, subdomain enumeration, and dir/file brute-forcing.
- Focused on **target fingerprinting** and weak entry points.

### 📱 Android Spyware Research (Educational Only)
- Explored the structure of Android spyware, keyloggers, and payloads using Termux.
- Studied root vs. non-root behavior, permissions, and stealth delivery mechanisms.
- Emphasized **ethical use** in private, offline lab setups only.

### 🧪 Custom Plugin Development
- Built a simple vulnerable WordPress plugin for file upload testing.
- Practiced PHP basics, WordPress hooks, and plugin deployment strategies.
- Learned from debugging plugin errors using Apache and PHP logs.
